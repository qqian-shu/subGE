# subGE
This project proposes a subgraph representation model, subGE, for prediction of molecular compounds structure-activity relationships.

# Data Download and Preprocess
The open-source dataset used in this study was derived from the DeepChem package of MoleculeNet, and the molecular compound representations were in the SMILES format. You can download the csv data file from MoleculeNet. You can preprocess the csv file containing smiles into the format of an adjacency matrix using deepchemtodata.py.
